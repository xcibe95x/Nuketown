# Nuketown Definitive Edition

Nuketown is a faithful remake made in Valve Engine for Left 4 Dead 2 of the official Call of Duty Map.

I gladly present you Nuketown Definitive Edition, going Open Source for the upcoming 2024 year, as a gift to the community

You are allowed to edit and redistribute to any Workshop or Valve Engine that does not include Left 4 Dead 2
If you are able to fix the broken tanks spawn i'll gladly introduce your fix to the current release.

As many request a mod free version is now available, totally Vanilla, so you can use it on servers and with your own mods!
